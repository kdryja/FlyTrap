\section{Files overview}
Files that can be compiled and are considered main entry point for the given component are marked with an asterisk (\textbf{*})
\subsection{blockchain}
This module contains code responsible for communicating with blockchain.
\paragraph{blockchain.go} contains all logic related to making calls to Blockchain to retrieve or write data. It's referenced by FlyTrap when checking access permissions.
\paragraph{cmd/blockchain/main.go *} main executable and CLI when communicating with blockchain. Executing this file. 
\paragraph{flytrap.sol} smart contract definition written in Solidity.
\paragraph{flytrap.go} Solidity code translated into Golang, which then can be used to make calls towards blockchain.
\paragraph{logging.go} logic to query state of blockchain in order to pull logs to be used in web frontend.
\subsection{flytrap}
This module contains the main logic behind FlyTrap proxy. 
\paragraph{cmd/flytrap/main.go *} main executable of FlyTrap proxy.
\paragraph{summary.go} code containing logic to cache publishers/subscribers and dump them periodically as a transaction to blockchain.
\paragraph{verification.go} logic to query the GeoLite2 database in order to translate IP into a country that it is located in.
\paragraph{GeoLite2-Country.mmdb} MaxMind database file used to lookup IP addresses.
\subsection{mqttclient}
\paragraph{client.go *} simple MQTT client used to PUBLISH/SUBSCRIBE to MQTT Brokers, enhanced with extra functionality needed by FlyTrap calculating and attaching signature to CONNECT packets.
\subsection{webapp}
This module is used to start up a frontend instance for FlyTrap allowing inspecting of data stored on blockchain.
\paragraph{templates} HTML + JS files used to render the website.
\paragraph{main.go *} backend used to handle incoming requests and query blockchain, returning information filling the website.
\subsection{evaluation}
This folder contains dump of all tests performed for the purposes of evaluation.
